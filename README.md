## 🔍 Overview

With the rapid growth of digital news, users often struggle to read long articles.  
This system solves that problem by automatically summarizing news articles, translating them into multiple languages, and converting text into natural voice narration.

The application follows a **modular client-server architecture**, ensuring scalability, maintainability, and clean separation of concerns.
